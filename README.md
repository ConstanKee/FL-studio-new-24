___

***Image-Line's FL Studio, formerly known as FruityLoops (the app's original name from 1998), has matured into a powerful digital audio workstation (DAW). Although it's still clearly geared toward electronic music production "in the box" instead of recording live musicians playing acoustic instruments, you can record or create just about any audio project with it. If your memory of FL Studio is closer to its rootsâ€”when the Belgian company's audio editing app looked more like a 1980s Amiga tracker than a proper DAWâ€”prepare to be amazed at how far the program has come. Still, it caters more to step-sequencer and pattern-based playlist fans than those expecting a more linear multitrack recording experience. For all-around recording, mixing, and production, our Editors' Choice winners are Logic Pro for Mac and Avid Pro Tools for PC***
